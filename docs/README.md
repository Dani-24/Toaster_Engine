## Introduction

Welcome to the [Toaster Engine](https://github.com/Dani-24/Toaster_Engine) website. Here you can find anything related with the developed engine and it's functionalities.

First of all, let me introduce myself, I'm Dani Toledo Rodr√≠guez , in github [Dani24](https://github.com/Dani-24), a student trying to learn and improve in videogame design and development. 

## About the Engine : FEATURES

[Toaster Engine](https://github.com/Dani-24/Toaster_Engine) is an open-source simple 3d videogame engine currently in development programmed in C++ [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org).

The engine UI works thanks to [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and it has implemented the following features to be Unity-like:

### Scene & Editor Views

At the center of the screen you can choose between the Editor & the Scene views, the editor is where you will edit and do all the job, while the scene will be the result processed view of whatever you're doing. The Editor works with an editor camera controlled with the mouse, but the Scene works with Camera GameObjects that you can interact with at the Inspector by selecting them at the Editor.
